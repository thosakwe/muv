Making front-end bearable by...
* Just about eliminating the need to write CSS
* Including HTML within JS with *way more sugars* than JSX
* Easy interop with useful libraries
* Easy to use with Polymer elements, i.e. COMPONENTS OUT OF THE BOX!!! (omg!!!)
* Forced use of ES6, i.e. `const`, `let`, `import`
* Tree-shaking
* Strong typing and linting to prevent errors

Muv takes the vast majority of its syntax from JavaScript; ES6, to be specific.
The language is entirely suited toward developing single-page applications, and intends
to make it extremely fast to develop.

The reason for this is relatively simple - I feel that front-end development in general is extremely
tedious, and in any full-stack project I make, it takes an *extremely* disproportionate amount of time
to bring up the UI, compared to the server, which I can write in a few hours, thanks to
[Angel](https://angel-dart.github.io). I have many ideas, but not a lot of money to finance them,
and subsequently, no team to develop them with. A huge barrier to my success, in my opinion, is the
fact that I give up on many projects because they will take too long to develop, for too high a risk.

Is it worth a whole new language? Not necessarily. But it is worth a new compiler. It'll take quite a while
to finish this, but if I do...
